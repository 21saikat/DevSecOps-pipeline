- **🛡️ Container Security**: Includes image scanning and runtime protection for containerized applications.  
- **✅ Compliance Enforcement**: Enforce policies aligned with industry standards and best practices.  
- **🔗 End-to-End Workflow**: From development to production, ensuring security is built-in, not an afterthought.  

## 📂 Structure  
- **`/ci-cd`**: Contains pipeline scripts and configuration files.  
- **`/security`**: Security tools, configurations, and scan reports.  
- **`/docs`**: Documentation and best practices for the pipeline.
